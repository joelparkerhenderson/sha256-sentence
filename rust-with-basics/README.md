This is a Rust implementation of coding challenge that searches for a sentence that describes its own SHA256 checksum.

This project demonstrates:

* Iteration via the standard library. This is without parallelization.

* Permutation via the itertools crate. This is without replacement.

* A local system time variable. This is without multi-thread safety.
 
Run:

```sh
cargo run --release
```

Output:

```
